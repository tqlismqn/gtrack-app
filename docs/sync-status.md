# Docs Sync Attempt

## Goal

- Fix the guard failure by updating the latest open PR with the required "Docs updated" block, retriggering CI, turning on auto-merge, and manually nudging the docs portal sync.

## What Happened

1. Tried to locate the latest open PR via `gh pr list --repo "tqlismqn/gtrack-app" ...`, but the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed in this environment, so the command could not run.
2. Because the PR metadata could not be retrieved, the "Docs updated" block could not be injected into the PR body.
3. With no PR context, issuing an empty commit and pushing to retrigger CI was also impossible.
4. Auto-merge could not be enabled without an authenticated `gh` session.
5. Attempting to run `gh workflow run -R "tqlismqn/gtrack-docs" docs-auto-sync.yml --ref main` likewise failed due to the missing CLI, so the docs portal sync was not nudged.

## Next Steps

- Install and authenticate the GitHub CLI (`gh`) so the scripted steps above can be re-run.
- Once `gh` is available, repeat the commands in the instructions to update the PR, retrigger checks, and kick off the docs sync workflow.
